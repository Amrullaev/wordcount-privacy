    <h1>Privacy Policy — Word Count</h1>
    <p>This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains how the Word Count application (“App”, “we”, “our”) handles and protects the privacy and personal information of its users.</p>

    <h2>1. General Information</h2>
    <p>Word Count is a mobile application designed for counting words, characters, and sentences in a text. The App performs all of its main functions completely offline.</p>

    <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>The Word Count App may process information only in the following case: the App processes and counts the text that you manually enter into your device. The App does not automatically collect personal data such as contacts, location, files, or device identifiers.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Data</h2>
    <p>The App uses your text solely for the following purposes: counting words, characters, sentences, and paragraphs; and displaying the result to the user through the interface.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Transmission</h2>
    <p>By default, Word Count does not send any data to the internet and does not store information on servers. If future optional features such as exporting or saving to cloud storage are introduced, this Policy will be updated accordingly.</p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>

    <h2>6. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The App only requests permissions when necessary and only with explicit user consent. The current offline functionality does not require any permissions.</p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directly intended for children. If you are submitting information on behalf of a child under the age of 13, please ensure that parental consent has been obtained.</p>

    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <p>We take standard industry security measures to protect user information. If any data transmission to servers is introduced in future updates, such data will be encrypted and stored with restricted access.</p>

    <h2>9. Policy Updates</h2>
